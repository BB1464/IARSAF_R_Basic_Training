## Install R

The first thing you need to do is download the R software. Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (aka “CRAN”) website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the software for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

---

### Working Directly in R

1. Enter: 2 + 2

2. Hit return

3. View result

---


### Your Turn

1. Download and Install R

--

1. Open R

--

1. Use any mathematical operators (+, -, /, and *) to create an expression and make sure it works as expected


---


## RStudio
---

### Download RStudio

Download RStudio at the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Ignore the various versions listed there. All you need is the latest version of RStudio Desktop.

### RStudio

If you use RStudio, you’ll have a integrated development environment (IDE), the ability to see all of your stored information, and much more.

### Your Turn

1. Download and Install RStudio

# Projects


--

Projects allow you to keep a collection of files all together, including: 

--

- R scripts

--

- RMarkdown files (more on those soon)

--

- Data files

--

- And much more!


---

### Sample Project

---


### How to Create a Project


1. File -> New Project

--

2. Quit RStudio, Double-click .Rproj file to reopen project

---

class:inverse

### Your Turn

1. Create a new project (doesn't matter if it's in a new or existing directory)

--

2. Quit RStudio, double-click the .Rproj file and reopen your project

# Files in R


## File Types

There are **two main file types** that you'll work with: 

.pull-left[
**R scripts (.R)**
]

--

.pull-right[

**RMarkdown files (.Rmd)**

Text is assumed to be text unless you put it in a code chunk (more on this soon)

![](images/code-chunk.png)

]


---

## R Scripts


Create new script file: File -> New File -> R Script

![](images/new-script.gif)


---


## How to Run Code

Run the code: control + enter on Windows,  command + enter on Mac keystrokes or use Run button

![](images/run-code.gif)


???

Note that you don't have to highlight code. 

You can just hit run anywhere on line to run code.

# Packages

---

## Packages

Packages add functionality that is not present in base R. 

They're where much of the power of R is found.

---

## Packages We'll Use throughout this training

.pull-left[

.center[
![](images/tidyverse.png)



]

]


.pull-right[

### `tidyverse`

The [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of packages. 

We'll use [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) to import data. 

]

---

## Packages We'll Use



.pull-left[

### `skimr`

[`skimr`](https://github.com/ropensci/skimr) provides easy summary statistics.

]


.pull-right[

## Install Packages

The syntax to install packages is as follows. 

```{r eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("skimr")
```

The package name must be in quotes.

--

.dk-highlight-box[
Packages should be installed **once per computer** (i.e. once you've installed a package, you don't need to do it again on the same computer).
]

---

## Load Packages

To load packages, use the following syntax:

```{r eval = T}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

Package names don't need to be quoted here (though they can be).

--

.dk-highlight-box[
Packages should be loaded **once per session** (i.e. every time you start working in R, you need to load any packages you want to use). 
]



---




---


## R is Case Sensitive

R is **case sensitive** so choose one of the following for all objects and **be consistent**.
.pull-left[
**Option**

snake_case 

camelCase

periods.in.names
]

--

.pull-right[

**Example**

student_data

studentData

student.data
]




---


## Directories

If the data file is in the working directory, you only need to specify its name before you can read it into R.


--

If the data file is not in the working directory, you need to specify full path name. 

--

When specifying the path name use of forward slash (“/”) not backslash (“\”).


---

## Where Does our Data Live?

Data we have imported is available in the environment/history pane.

# In our next training we will learn how to read data into R.

# Objects and Functions

## Objects and Functions

--

> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:

--

> Everything that exists is an **object**, and 

--

> Everything that happens is a **function** call.

--

John Chambers, quoted in [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html).
