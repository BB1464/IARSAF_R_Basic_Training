# Data Types in R
1 Vector
A vector is a basic data structure in R. It contains elemnet of the same type. It is further classified into 6 data types which is called atomic vectors. The names of the six atomic vectors are as follows.
- Numeric
- Integer
- Logical
- Character
- Complex
- Raw

# let us create a simple vector
# N/B We can create a vector with the c(), function where the **c** stands for combine or concatenate. Since a vector must have elements of the same type, this function will try and coerce elements to the same type, if they are different.

```{r Numeric_Vector}
vec1<-c(1,2,5) # This is a numeric vector
class(vec1)
typeof(vec1)
class(vec1)
```

# Let us create a character vector
```{r Character_vector}
vec2<-c('Black','Yellow','White')
class(vec2)
typeof(vec2)
length(vec2)
nchar(vec2)
```

2. List
List is a data structure having components of mixed data types. i.e a vector having elements of different type is called a list. 
# Let us create a list
```{r list}
list1<-list(1,'Blue',2.4,'Green')
typeof(list1)
class(list1)
length(list1)
```

3. Matrix
Matrix is a two dimentional data structure in R programming. Matrix is similar to vector but additionally contains the dimension attribute. 
```{r matrix}
mat1<-matrix(1:9,nrow = 3,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
class(mat1)
typeof(mat1)
attributes(mat1)
```

4. Factors
Factors is a data structure used for fields that takes only predefined, finite number of values (categorical data). e.g male and female. Factors is normally created with the factor function in R.

```{r}
fact1<-factor('Male','Female')
class(fact1)
```

5. Data frane
Data frame is a two dimensional data structure in R. It is a special case of a list which has each component of equal length. Each component form the column and the contents of the component form the rows.

```{r}
df1<-data.frame(Age=c(10,15,20,30),Month=c('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr'))
class(df1)
typeof(df1)
head(df1)
tail(df1)
```

# Setting of Working Directory
Once you open R, your present working directory is always your root directory that you select when you where installing R.
- To get your present working directory
# Type the code below
getwd()    # What do you see ?

# To set your working directory 

setwd('path') # But this is not necessary since we are using the Rproj and our path is set already.

# Reading Data into R
- To read in a csv file into R we will use read_csv  # tidyverse
- To read in an excel file into R we will use read_excel # tidyverse

```{r Load_Library}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
```



```{r}
read_csv(here::here('data/sorghum.csv')) 
# Congratulation you have successfully read a csv file into R
# Now assign it to an object called dat1
```

```{r}
read_excel(here::here('data/oats.xlsx'))
# Assign it into an object
```

# Let us make use of function from skim R to explore our data

```{r}
skim(dat1)
```

# Let use some functions from tidyverse to explore our data
```{r}
dat %>% slice_head(n = 5)
dat %>% slice_tail(n=5)
```


#### Data Cleaning  ####
# Here we are going to use function from tidyr

- The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

Every column is variable.
Every row is an observation.
Every cell is a single value.

- Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. If you ensure that your data is tidy, youâ€™ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in vignette("tidy-data")
