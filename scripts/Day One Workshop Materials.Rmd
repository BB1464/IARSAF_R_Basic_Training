# Data Types in R

1 Vector

A vector is a basic data structure in R. It contains elemnet of the same type. It is further classified into 6 data types which is called atomic vectors. The names of the six atomic vectors are as follows.

- Double

- Integer

- Logical

- Character

- Complex

- Raw

- let us create a simple vector

- N/B We can create a vector with the c(), function where the **c** stands for combine or concatenate. Since a vector must have elements of the same type, this function will try and coerce elements to the same type, if they are different.

```{r Numeric_Vector}
vec1<-c(1,2,5) # This is a numeric vector
class(vec1)
typeof(vec1)
class(vec1)
```

# Let us create a character vector
```{r Character_vector}
vec2<-c('Black','Yellow','White')
class(vec2)
typeof(vec2)
length(vec2)
nchar(vec2)
```

2. List

List is a data structure having components of mixed data types. i.e a vector having elements of different type is called a list. 

# Let us create a list
```{r list}
list1<-list(1,'Blue',2.4,'Green')
typeof(list1)
class(list1)
length(list1)
```

3. Matrix

Matrix is a two dimentional data structure in R programming. Matrix is similar to vector but additionally contains the dimension attribute. 

```{r matrix}
mat1<-matrix(1:9,nrow = 3,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
class(mat1)
typeof(mat1)
attributes(mat1)
```

4. Factors

Factors is a data structure used for fields that takes only predefined, finite number of values (categorical data). e.g male and female. Factors is normally created with the factor function in R.

```{r}
fact1<-factor('Male','Female')
class(fact1)
```

5. Data frane

Data frame is a two dimensional data structure in R. It is a special case of a list which has each component of equal length. Each component form the column and the contents of the component form the rows.

```{r}
df1<-data.frame(Age=c(10,15,20,30),Month=c('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr'))
class(df1)
typeof(df1)
head(df1)
tail(df1)
```

# Setting of Working Directory

Once you open R, your present working directory is always your root directory that you select when you where installing R.

- To get your present working directory

# Type the code below
getwd()    


# Reading Data into R

- To read in a csv file into R we will use read_csv  # tidyverse

- To read in an excel file into R we will use read_excel # tidyverse

```{r Load_Library}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
dat1<-read_csv(here::here('data/sorghum.csv')) 
# Congratulation you have successfully read a csv file into R
# Now assign it to an object called dat1
```

```{r}
dat2<-read_excel(here::here('data/oats.xlsx'))
```

<!-- # Let us make use of function from skim R to explore our data -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- skim(dat1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Let use some functions from tidyverse to explore our data

```{r}
dat1 %>% slice_head(n = 5)
dat1 %>% slice_tail(n=5)
```

#### Data Cleaning  using Tidyr ####

- The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, gramar, and data structures. Here we are going to look at functions from tidyr which is part of the tidyverse. One of the powerful function in the tidyverse is the pipes (%>%).

Pipes take the object on the **left** and apply the function on the **right**: Read out loud: "and then..."
Pipes save us typing, make code readable, and allow chaining function together, so we are going to use them **all the time** when manipulating data frames.



# Data Science Workflow using the Tidyverse


![](images/01_tidyverse_data_science.png)


# To install the tidyverse 

```{r tidyverse,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(tidyverse) # But you have already install this taht is why I set eval=FALSE in the code chunk
```
# To load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # To load the tidyverse
```

- The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. If you ensure that your data is tidy, youâ€™ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in **vignette("tidy-data")**

# We are going to make use of only four function from the tidyr package

- Pivot longer # Lengthens data, by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns

- Pivot wider # Widens data, by increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows.

- Seperate # Separate one column into multiple

- Unite   # Unite multiple column into one

# Let see an example

```{r}
data("billboard") # this data is from tidyr package and we are going to wrangle this data and produce insight from it
billboard %>% slice_head(n=5) # What do you observe about this dataset ?
# is it a tidydata ?
```

# Let us use the pivot longer function to clean this data
```{r pivot_longer}
bill<-billboard %>% pivot_longer(-c(1:3),names_to = "Weeks",values_to = 'Record') # Assign this to an object
```

# Let us seperate the date.entered into ymd
```{r separate}
bill2<-bill %>% separate(col = 'date.entered',into = c('Year','Month','Day'),sep = '-')
```

# Let return the dataset into a wide format 
```{r}
bill3<-bill %>% pivot_wider(names_from = 'Weeks',values_from = 'Record')
```


# Let us unite bill 2 data frame back
```{r}
bill4<-bill2 %>% unite(col = 'Date', c('Year','Month','Day'))
```

# You can practice on this functions by using it to solve real world question that is how you improve your data skills in R.
