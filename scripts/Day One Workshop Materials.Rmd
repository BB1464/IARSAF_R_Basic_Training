# Learning Outcomes

# Day 1

- Installation of R and RStudio

- Installation of packages required for the training

- Overview on the R and RStudio layout and menus

- Arithmetic Operations in R

- Data types and data structures in R

- Setting of working directory

- Reading data into R 

- Data Cleaning in R



# Arithmetic Operations in R

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Multiplication

- Division






# Data Types in R

1 Vector

A vector is a basic data structure in R. It contains elemnet of the same type. 

there are two types of vectors in R:

- Atomic vectors, of which there are six types: Double, Integer, logical, character, **complex** and **raw**. Integer and double vectors are collectively known as numeric vectors.


- List, which are sometimes called recursive vectors because list contains other lists (i.e they are heterogenous). A vector having element of different type is called a list.


- let us create a simple vector

- N/B We can create a vector with the c(), function where the **c** stands for combine or concatenate. Since a vector must have elements of the same type, this function will try and coerce elements to the same type, if they are different.

```{r Numeric_Vector}

```

# Let us create a character vector
```{r Character_vector}

```


# Let us create a list
```{r list}

```

3. Matrix

Matrix is a two dimentional data structure in R programming. Matrix is similar to vector but additionally contains the dimension attribute. 

```{r matrix}

```

4. Factors

Categorical data are commonly represented in R as factors.
Factors is normally created with the factor function in R.

```{r}

```

5. Data frame

Data frame is a two dimensional data structure in R. It is a special case of a list which has each component of equal length. Each component form the column and the contents of the component form the rows.

```{r dataframe}

```

# Setting of Working Directory

Once you open R, your present working directory is always your root directory that you select when you where installing R.

- To get your present working directory

# Type the code below
getwd()    


# Reading Data into R

- To read in a csv file into R we will use read_csv 

- To read in an excel file into R we will use read_excel 

```{r Load_Library}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
```

```{r sorghum_dataset}
dat1<-read_csv(here::here('data/sorghum.csv')) 
# Congratulation you have successfully read a csv file into R
# Now assign it to an object
```

# Your turn read in the oat dataset into R and assign it to an object called dat2
```{r oats_dataset}

```

# Let use some functions from tidyverse to explore our data
# Slice and ....

```{r data_exploration}

```

#### Data Cleaning  using Tidyr ####

- The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, gramar, and data structures. Here we are going to look at functions from tidyr which is part of the tidyverse. One of the powerful function in the tidyverse is the pipes (%>%).

Pipes take the object on the **left** and apply the function on the **right**: Read out loud: "and then..."
Pipes save us typing, make code readable, and allow chaining function together, so we are going to use them **all the time** when manipulating data frames.



# Data Science Workflow using the Tidyverse

# To install the tidyverse 

```{r tidyverse,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(tidyverse) # But you have already install this taht is why I set eval=FALSE in the code chunk
```
# To load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # To load the tidyverse
```

- The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. If you ensure that your data is tidy, youâ€™ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in **vignette("tidy-data")**

# We are going to make use of only four function from the tidyr package

- Pivot longer # Lengthens data, by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns

- Pivot wider # Widens data, by increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows.

- Seperate # Separate one column into multiple

- Unite   # Unite multiple column into one

# Let see an example using the billboard dataset in tidyr

```{r billboard_dataset}
data("billboard") # this data is from tidyr package and we are going to wrangle this data and produce insight from it
billboard %>% slice_head(n=5) # What do you observe about this dataset ?
# is it a tidydata ?
```

# Let us use the pivot longer function to clean this data
```{r pivot_longer}

```

# Let us apply the separate function to rate in table 3
```{r separate}
table3 %>% separate(rate,into = c('Rate','Count'))
```

# Let return the billboard dataset into a wide format 
```{r}

```


# Let us unite bill 2 data frame back
```{r}
bill4<-bill2 %>% unite(col = 'Date', c('Year','Month','Day'))
```

# You can practice on this functions by using it to solve real world question that is how you improve your data skills in R.
